
// STEP 6: Wrap the entire contents of SpeakGoodBye.js inside of an IIFE

// STEP 7: Create an object, called 'byeSpeaker' to which you will attach
/*the "speak" method and which you will expose to the global context
DO NOT attach the speakWord variable to the 'byeSpeaker' object.8*/

//STEP 8: Rewrite the 'speak' function such that it is attached to the
// byeSpeaker object instead of being a standalone function.

// STEP 9: Expose the 'byeSpeaker' object to the global scope. Name it
// 'byeSpeaker' on the global scope as well.
